# Adam-Day-Planner  

## Description

- my motivation was to create a day planner that was reactive to the time of day - using APIs to do so
- I built this project to track your daily schedule and colour coordinate past, present and future time slots based on current time
- This project allows you to plan your day and keep track of daily tasks; it uses jquery, bootstrap and day.js to do so.
- I learn't how APIs can be used in collaboration and the ability to use APIs like jquery to shorthand syntax complex javascript code and to understand how other APIs can be utilised.
